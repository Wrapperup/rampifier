This is a sample tool created that takes plates and rampifies it. May be super useful for creating (organic) brick props like trees, rocks, terrain, etc.

## Using Plate Rampifier
See releases for binary downloads.

Rampifier takes two arguments, the input of the save file and the output `.brs` path. If none is specified, `in.brs` and `out.brs` are used in the same directory as the binary file.

For example, use
`plate-rampifier my_input.brs the_output.brs` or any path to rampify a save.
